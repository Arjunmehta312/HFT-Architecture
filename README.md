# High-Frequency Trading (HFT) System Architecture

This repository contains the architectural design for a high-frequency trading system, engineered for ultra-low latency execution in microseconds and nanoseconds. The system is designed to process thousands to millions of trades per second, making split-second decisions to capture market inefficiencies.

## System Components

### 1. Market Data Ingestion
![Market Data Ingestion](Market%20Data%20Ingestion/Market%20Data%20Ingestion.svg)

The first critical component handles real-time market data feeds from exchanges. It uses:
- Ultra-low latency Network Interface Cards (NICs)
- Custom TCP stack with kernel bypass mechanisms
- Multicast feeds for direct data delivery
- Market data feed handler for protocol decoding and transformation

### 2. In-memory Order Book and Replication

Maintains a real-time snapshot of all current buy and sell orders:
- In-memory storage for zero-latency access
- Replicated order books (Replica A and B) for fault tolerance
- Real-time updates with every market message
- Event stream publication for downstream components

### 3. Event-Driven Pipeline and Nanosecond Timestamping

The backbone of real-time processing:
- Lock-free queues optimized for throughput
- Nanosecond precision clock for event timestamping
- Precise sequencing of market updates
- Component latency benchmarking

### 4. Tick-to-Trade with FPGA Acceleration

Hardware-optimized execution:
- Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for custom logic
- Sub-microsecond latency trading decisions
- Direct connection to event queues
- Hardware-level strategy implementation

### 5. Strategy Engine

Core trading logic implementation:
- Market making engine
- Real-time strategy evaluation
- Rule-based, statistical, or ML-based decision making
- Microsecond-level decision processing

### 6. Smart Order Router & Pre-Trade Risk Checks

Order execution and risk management:
- Multi-venue order routing
- Pre-trade risk validation
- Real-time liquidity evaluation
- Execution optimization

### 7. OMS, Monitoring & Latency Dashboards
![Monitoring](OMS%2C%20Monitoring%20%26%20Latency%20Dashboards/OMS%2C%20Monitoring%20%26%20Latency%20Dashboards.svg)

System monitoring and management:
- Order Management System (OMS)
- Real-time latency monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- System health tracking
- Compliance reporting

## Key Features

- **Ultra-Low Latency**: Engineered for microsecond and nanosecond-level execution
- **High Throughput**: Capable of processing millions of trades per second
- **Fault Tolerance**: Redundant components and failover mechanisms
- **Real-Time Processing**: Event-driven architecture with nanosecond precision
- **Hardware Acceleration**: FPGA integration for critical path optimization
- **Risk Management**: Comprehensive pre-trade risk checks
- **Monitoring**: Real-time system health and performance tracking

## Performance Considerations

- Every microsecond counts in HFT systems
- Components are optimized for speed and predictability
- Hardware acceleration is used where possible
- Network latency is minimized through co-location
- System monitoring is critical for maintaining edge
